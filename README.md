- 👋 Hi, I’m @ccdm-edu
- 👀 I’m interested in creating a website that starts with interesting topics of interest to teens (starting with music) and ties it back to the math (Geometry, Algebra 1 and 2) 
that they need to know for their exams.  The goal is to show them that all those "stupid, boring, useless" equations drive their world and make cool stuff possible.  The site is 
highly interactive and is designed to generate excitement about math among bright, motiviated students who currently don't like math.  For those who do like math, it will be like 
a playground introduction to college level concepts.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning client and server side coding.  I do have a MCS from UIUC and some C++ coding experience (mostly my work experience was as a EE) but I need to get 
better at Javascript/JQuery, HTML/CSS and Python/Django
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how to get Safari to like my site.  I have been doing development work in Eclipse/Chrome.  It seems Safari wants JQuery...  My site kinda doesn't work
in Safari and I don't really have time to debug that and add new material.  Plus, Safari expects you to buy a Mac if you want to have full debug mode in Safari (THANK you Google for 
not making such expensive requirements to debug on Chrome)
